I am a [Developer Advocate](https://developers.sap.com/) with the SAP Global Developer & Community Relations team at SAP.  In this role, I focus on developer outreach and technology adoption for both the ABAP development and HANA development topics.

I co-authored the SAP Press book, Next Generation ABAP Development and have been recongonized as a SAP Mentor Alumni, a HANA Distinguished Engineer(HDE), and a SAP Technology Ambassador.
